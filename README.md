# FAKE-NEWS-PREDICTION
The project aims to build a machine learning model that can automatically
identify and classify fake news articles from genuine ones using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With the proliferation
of misinformation in the digital age, this project holds significant importance
in promoting media literacy and combatting the spread of
fake news.
